    "After narrowly escaping the witch's lair, you find yourself walking down a dimly lit, ominous hallway. Each door you try is securely locked, as if warning you not to disturb what lies behind them. However, one grand door stands invitingly open. You step into a majestic library. It's a peculiar mix of dusty and tidy, as if time has forgotten it, but someone or something still maintains it. No sooner have you taken a few steps than the door slams shut behind you, locking you in. Enormous windows reach up to the ceiling, teasing a view of the outside world that you can't touch; they won't budge. Towering shelves filled with ancient texts and mysteries surround you.",

    "Just as you start to absorb your surroundings, a soft thud breaks the silence. A small, antique lamp on a reading table tips over on it's own. Your heart skips a beat as a translucent figure appears before you — a ghost! But fear not, for this is no ordinary ghost. He displays a playful, mischievous spirit rather than a sinister one. \"Ah, you look quite lost, my friend,\" he says, floating around you in a whimsical manner. \"Tell you what, I'll help you escape this place, but you have to do something for me first.\"",
    <br />,
    <br />,
    "The ghost grins. \"See, I'm in a friendly competition with my ghostly brothers, and we're stuck on some riddles. They think they're so clever,\" he rolls his eyes, \"but with your help, I can best them all and win the ultimate bragging rights! Solve the riddles for me, and I promise, I'll show you the secret way out of here.\" You consider his offer. It seems you have a new challenge ahead. The library might be a prison for now, but it's also filled with the promise of freedom — if you can solve the ghost's riddles.",
